# Project: Divvy Station placement and efficiency analysis
- Conducted EDA and employed K-means Clustering to pinpoint strategic station locations for maximum impact..
- Achieved 92% accuracy in yearly bike usage forecasting using Facebookâ€™s Prophet Library.
- Contributed to enhanced operational efficiency, ensuring optimal allocation of resources and improved user experience.
- Evaluate the efficiency of current placement of divvy stops. Propose better locations for the stops and evaluate the efficiency of the newly proposed stops.
